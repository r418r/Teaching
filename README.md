## Introduction

The Study-Sheet is a lesson planning tool that has been refined over the last three years of teaching. It consists of the following sections to ensure that students are engaged and have the necessary tools to master complex topics:

1. **Intro**: A brief overview of the topic, providing a sense of what’s coming and why it matters.
2. **Guided Notes**: This includes resources, key concepts, questions, and a guided approach to understanding the material.
3. **Examples**: Problems with links to full solutions that illustrate how to approach specific challenges.
4. **Problems**: A set of problems for the students to solve, where the answers are visible upon choice but no solutions are provided immediately.

## How to Use Study-Sheet

The Study-Sheet template can be adapted for any subject area. Here’s how you can use the template:

- **For Educators**: You can fill in each section based on the topic you’re teaching. The template gives a clear structure that supports both independent study and guided learning.
- **For Students**: Use the Study-Sheet to stay organized, review key concepts, practice problems, and self-assess your understanding.
- **For Self Study**: Use the Study-Sheet to plan for your own learning outside a curriculum. By doing this, you are not only self-studying, but you are also self-teaching.

## Folder Structure

The Study-Sheet repository is organized as follows:

- **Study-Sheet_Template/**: Contains the core structure of the Study-Sheet, with markdown files for each section (Intro, Guided Notes, Examples, Problems).
- **Examples/**: A collection of example problems that showcase how different topics can be taught.
- **Resources/**: Educational materials that support the lessons, including textbook excerpts and open-source online resources.
